            <p>We set the agenda in the morning. To host a session, anybody can pitch a topic to the crowd and we facilitate the decision. Some sessions, key-notes/pecha-kucha and Hold-Ups are planned in advance however.</p>
            <p>Sessions are generally participatory in nature, typically without powerpoint. SenseCampers vote with their feet and leave sessions they do not want to participate in. The format blurs traditional notions of speakers and listeners and creates a highly interactive experience of shared learning and development.</p>
